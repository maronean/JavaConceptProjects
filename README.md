# JavaConceptProjects
A collection of Java projects. Each demonstrates the implementation of different programing concepts. 

#Calculus 
Includes classes to represent  and perform various
mathematical functions.
Sum contains both derivative and integral classes.

FunctionTest class demonstrates the use of each class

#Defect Predictor
An implementation of Naive-Bayes classification to predict potential project failures given data from prevous project history.

Designed to take a csv formatted set of data including a standard set of numerical features.
Each line in the csv should end in a 1 or 0
1 - representing defects present
0 - representing no defects

Is designed to perform cross validation on results and ouput the Precision and recall of solutions found.
